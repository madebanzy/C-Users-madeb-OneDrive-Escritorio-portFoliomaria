            <h2>Paralegal</h2>
            <h3>Since my arrival in the United States, I have had the opportunity to develop a career<br>
                in the immigration field, a passion that I never anticipated but came naturally to me.<br>
                I am grateful to immigration attorney Carmen Bello for the opportunity to work under<br>
                her guidance since 2021 which has enabled me to become a legal assistant in the<br>
                immigration field. Through this experience, I have acquired extensive knowledge and<br>
                skills, working alongside a highly competent and honest lawyer. If you are seeking<br>
                legal consultation, please feel free to visit our Google page and contact us to schedule<br>
                a consultation and initiate a case.</h3>
